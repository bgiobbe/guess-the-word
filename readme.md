# Guess-the-Word game
I wrote this game as an exercise for Skillcrush's Javascript Fundamentals class. Since its purpose was to improve and showcase my javascript skills, I wrote 3 versions: first, by myself; second, following Skillcrush's instructions; third, my Skillcrush-informed "final" version. 
## first_cut branch
Written by myself, given the HTML and CSS in the starter.
## skillcrush branch
Written by following Skillcrush's instructions, from the same starter.
## main branch
Final version, my own, after seeing Skillcrush's implementation. This is a good representation of my javascript coding skills.
